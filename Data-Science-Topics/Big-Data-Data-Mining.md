‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Computing, Deployment and Service Models
--


#### Describe cloud computing concepts:

- 

#### Define cloud deployment models and service models:

- Deployments:
    
    - Public - use is shared by other companies;
    - Private - infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization
    - Hibridy - mix of public and private

- Models:

    - IaaS (Infrastucture) - delivery data centers, servers, networking and storage;
    - Paas (Plataform) - hardware and software tools to develop and deploy applications to users over the internet; 
    - Saas (Service) - software and application are license and hosted on a subscription basis 

#### Identify characteristics of cloud computing:

- On-demand self-service;
-  Broad network access - trough mobile, desktops and laptops;
- Resource pooling - cost efficient;
- Rapid elasticity - use what you need, increase or decrease, depends on costumers demand;
- Measured service - pay for waht you use, or reserve to go;
- Is about to using technology as a service, increase or decrease and pay for waht you use;
- Change the way consumes compute services.

### Cloud for Data Science:
- Work with multiple people from different places, countries at the same time;
- Bypass phisical limitations, to storage or run algorithms.

üé≤ Foundations of Big Data
--

- V's of big data:
    - Velocity: data is being created and accumulated extremelly fast, in different devices;
    - Volume: increase the data stored volume
    - Variety: different type of data, structure or unstructure, also comes from different sources;
    - Veracity: quality and origin of data
    - Value: turn data into value
