# ðŸ¤– Generative AI and Data Science:

### What is generative AI ?

- Produces new data as images, music, language, code and more;

### How does generative AI work ?

- Generatve adversarial networks (GANS) and/or Variatonal auto-encoders (VAEs) are the foundation;
- Replicates underlying features of original data;
- Teachs AI to learn patterns of large volume of data;

### Applications of generative AI

- Natural Language Processing (NLP), like Chat-GPT;
- Healthcare;
- Create art as images, endless creative;
- Personalized shopping recommendations, creating new styles.

## How data scientist uses generative AI


### Synthetic Data:
- Data sets may not have enough data to build a model;
- Generative AI creates data with similar properties;
- Use synthetic data for model trainig and testing;

### Coding automation:
- Generate software code to construct models;
- Focus on higher-level tasks;

### Uncover insights:
- Uncover hidden patterns and insights may go unknowled;
- Generate insights and reports;
- Enhance desicion-making;
